This is a blog article written by Nicholas Yang, a class of 2021 NYU alum. I'm a pretty big fan of his writing, especially his career advice and software takes. While he was an undergrad, he ran a blog for an NYU club called [Burn Rate](https://blog.torchnyu.com/), where he published some semi-controversial articles such as [GOTO NYU CS Considered Harmful](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/11/12/goto-nyu-cs-considered-harmful.html) and [Intellectual Ambition](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/12/10/intellectual-ambition.html), which I recommend checking out.

This article stood out to me because it challenges the way many universities treat the phrase “CS is not programming.” While it’s true that computer science is broader than just writing code, this mindset has led to a gap where students are often left to teach themselves how to actually program. I liked his point that programming can be a powerful way to learn core CS concepts and could help make the field more accessible. This class feels like it's designed to address this issue by explicitly teaching students software engineering practices and preparing them for the real world (if they choose to become a software engineer).
